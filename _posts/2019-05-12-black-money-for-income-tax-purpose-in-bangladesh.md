All payments made out of unaccounted funds, which have not borne the due tax liability, are black money transactions. Payments for services of plumbers, electricians, mechanics, housemaids, etc. are also made in cash. School and clollege fees for children are invariably paid in cash. Large payments to hotels, restaurants and travel agents may also be made in cash. Payments made in cashcould be out accounted or unaccounted funnds. We often hear a remark in the context of immovable property transactions, i.e. when we want to buy or sell a property, it ususally goes thus - How much by cheque or in Number 1 and how much by cash or in Number 2 ?
